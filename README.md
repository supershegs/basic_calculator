Assignment: Basic Flask Calculator 
Create a minimal Flask web application that functions as a basic calculator. Instructions: 
1. Setup: 
- Install Flask if it's not already installed on your system. 
- Create a new directory for your project and set up a virtual environment. 
2. Create the Flask Application: 
- Build a Flask web application that has one route ("/") to serve a simple HTML form. - The form should include two input fields for numbers, a dropdown menu for operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), and a "Calculate" button. 
3. Form Handling: 
- Implement form handling for the calculation form. 
- When the user submits the form, extract the user's input (two numbers and the selected operation). 
- Calculate the result based on the selected operation. 
4. Result Display: 
- Display the calculation result on the same page ("/") beneath the form, or you can create separate route ("/result") to display the result. 
5. Styling (Optional): 
- Add minimal CSS styling to make the form and result visually appealing.
